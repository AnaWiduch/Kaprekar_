# Kaprekar_
This repository contains a Python function kaprekar_step(L) that implements one step of the Kaprekar process for a list of natural numbers.



The function kaprekar_step(L) that takes a list of natural numbers (digits of which make up the number going through the Kaprekar process), performs 1 step of convergence to the Kaprekar constant, and returns the resulting number.

The function should create two numbers inside:

in ascending order of digits in the original list
in descending order of digits in the original list
Subtract the smaller number from the larger number and return the result.
